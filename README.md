# GNN Parametrized Forcefields

## Description
Repository for the models used in the publication ['Regularized by Physics: Graph Neural Network Parametrized Potentials for the Description of Intermolecular Interactions'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00355).

## Multipoles
The model was trained to be used in conjunction with the multipole model which can be found here:
